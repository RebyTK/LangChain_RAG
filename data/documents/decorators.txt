Decorators in Python are a powerful feature that allows you to modify or enhance functions and methods without changing their source code. A decorator is essentially a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function.

Syntax:
@decorator_name
def function_name():
    pass

Common use cases:
- Logging function calls
- Timing function execution
- Access control and authentication
- Caching/memoization
- Input validation

Example:
def timer_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end-start:.2f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer_decorator
def slow_function():
    time.sleep(1)
    return "Done"

Python also supports decorator chaining, where multiple decorators can be applied to a single function.
