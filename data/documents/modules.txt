Modules in Python are files containing Python code that can be imported and used in other programs. They help organize code into logical units and promote code reuse.

Importing modules:
- import module_name
- from module_name import function_name
- from module_name import *
- import module_name as alias

Standard library modules:
- os: Operating system interface
- sys: System-specific parameters
- math: Mathematical functions
- datetime: Date and time handling
- json: JSON data handling
- re: Regular expressions
- random: Random number generation

Creating your own module:
Simply create a .py file with functions, classes, or variables. The filename (without .py) becomes the module name.

Package structure:
A package is a directory containing multiple modules. It must include an __init__.py file (can be empty) to be recognized as a package.

Example package structure:
my_package/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py

Importing from packages:
from my_package import module1
from my_package.module1 import function_name

Modules and packages are essential for organizing large Python projects.
