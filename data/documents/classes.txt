Python classes provide a way to bundle data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.

Basic class structure:
class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, parameters):
        self.attribute = value
    
    def method(self):
        return self.attribute

Key concepts:
- __init__: Constructor method called when creating an instance
- self: Reference to the instance itself
- Attributes: Variables that belong to the object
- Methods: Functions that belong to the object
- Inheritance: Classes can inherit from other classes
- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that work on that data

Example:
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

Python supports multiple inheritance, abstract base classes, and various object-oriented programming features.
