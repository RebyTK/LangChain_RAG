Python provides built-in functions for reading from and writing to files. File operations are essential for data persistence and processing.

Opening files:
file = open("filename.txt", "r")  # Read mode
file = open("filename.txt", "w")  # Write mode (overwrites)
file = open("filename.txt", "a")  # Append mode
file = open("filename.txt", "r+") # Read and write

Using context manager (recommended):
with open("filename.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    # File automatically closed when block exits

Reading file contents:
- file.read(): Read entire file as string
- file.readline(): Read single line
- file.readlines(): Read all lines as list
- for line in file: Iterate over lines

Writing to files:
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Text to write\n")
    file.writelines(["Line 1\n", "Line 2\n"])

File modes:
- "r": Read (default)
- "w": Write (creates new or overwrites)
- "a": Append
- "x": Exclusive creation (fails if exists)
- "b": Binary mode
- "t": Text mode (default)

Best practices:
- Always use context managers (with statement)
- Handle FileNotFoundError exceptions
- Specify encoding for text files: open("file.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8")
- Use pathlib.Path for modern path handling
