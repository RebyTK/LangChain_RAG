List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists in Python. They consist of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses.

Basic syntax: [expression for item in iterable]

Examples:
- squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
- even_numbers = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0]
- uppercase = [name.upper() for name in names]

List comprehensions are generally more efficient and readable than equivalent for loops. They can also be nested for working with multi-dimensional data structures.

Advanced example:
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flattened = [num for row in matrix for num in row]
# Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
