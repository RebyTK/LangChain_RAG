Iterators in Python are objects that can be iterated upon. They implement the iterator protocol, which consists of __iter__() and __next__() methods.

Creating iterators:
class CountDown:
    def __init__(self, start):
        self.current = start
    
    def __iter__(self):
        return self
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.current <= 0:
            raise StopIteration
        self.current -= 1
        return self.current + 1

Iterables vs Iterators:
- Iterable: Object that can return an iterator (has __iter__())
- Iterator: Object that implements __next__() method

Common iterables:
- Lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries
- File objects
- Generator objects
- Range objects

Generators:
Generators are a simple way to create iterators using functions with yield statements.

def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

Generator expressions:
squares = (x**2 for x in range(10))

Benefits of generators:
- Memory efficient (lazy evaluation)
- Can represent infinite sequences
- Cleaner syntax than custom iterator classes

The itertools module provides many useful iterator tools for complex iteration patterns.
